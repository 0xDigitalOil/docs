# Deployed Addresses

## Registry
The ERC-6551 Registry contract has been deployed to goerli and sepolia. Upon completion of a final audit, the registry will be deployed across all EVM-compatible networks.

The registry contract is deployed to the same address across all chains.

*Note: until ERC-6551 is finalized, the registry address is subject to change*.
