# Introduction

The iframe allows NFT collections to take advantage of OpenSea's [animation_url](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) metadata param. Basically you can
embed a web app in the detailed view of a NFT collection on OpenSea. The iframe is important for projects looking to use tokenbound accounts(TBA) for a number of reasons:

1. View your TBA
2. View assets such as ERC-721, ERC-1155, ether and ERC-20 tokens
3. Check if any ERC-721, or ERC-1155 tokens have global or token level approvals. This important information for users who are looking to buy an NFT and the contents within it's TBA, as tokens with pending approvals could have potential be sold right before the NFT is purchased.
4. View status of the TBA. The status indicates if the TBA is locked or unlocked. Locked state allows users to feel confident with purchasing an NFT and not have to worry about
   tokens with pending approvals as nothing can be taken out for the specified time period.

Tokenbound currently provides two ways you can easily integrate iframes into your project without worrying about the above logic: `URL` and `Custom`.
