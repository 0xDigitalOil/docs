# Custom Implementation

This method is recommended for users who are looking to do more dynamic things in their iframe.
The current implementation of the URL relies on Alchemy's indexer to render the image. However,
if you require assets from a custom api then this is the method for you. For example, the [Sapienz](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x26727ed4f5ba61d3772d1575bca011ae3aef5d36/1)
project has a custom api that sorts the order of images based on what is equipped by the owner.

## Steps

1. Fork and clone the [iframe](https://github.com/tokenbound/iframe) repository:
   `git clone git@github.com:githubUser/iframe.git`
2. Run install with `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `npm`.
3. Create a `.env.local` file and copy the variables from `.env.example`
4. Create an account for [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and create an API key.
5. Add in the the Alchemy key to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT` env variables. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT` will be the `https` link.
6. Create an account for [n.xyz](https://n.xyz/) and api key. This is for checking token approvals.
7. Add in the n.xyz api key to `NEXT_PUBLIC_NXYZ_API_KEY`. Make sure you enable cors for `n.xyz` for the api key to your domain or `*` for all domains.
8. Now add in your custom api endpoint to fetch your NFT's assets to `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_ENDPOINT`. The api should return an array of strings as image links. Or just a string as an image link. Without this env variable, the app will assume you want your images fetched from alchemy.
9. To test this you can put in your the url `/contractAddress/tokenId` when running `pnpm dev` | `yarn dev` | `npm run dev`.
10. Host your app on Vercel and use the domain to link to your metadata server.
