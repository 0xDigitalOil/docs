# URL Implementation

The url method is recommended for projects who have a static image(s) and or have an existing project and wish to show their NFT's TBA.
All you have to do is update your metadata server and add the following this url `https://iframe-tokenbound.vercel.app/<contractAddress>/<tokenId>` as your `animation_url`.

For example, here's an example with Sapienz: [https://iframe-tokenbound.vercel.app/0x26727ed4f5ba61d3772d1575bca011ae3aef5d36/1](https://iframe-tokenbound.vercel.app/0x26727ed4f5ba61d3772d1575bca011ae3aef5d36/1)

Any updates to the iframe's design will be automatically happen and you will not have to worry about integrating the new updates.

This method currently only supports ethereum's mainnet. We are currently working to integrate this with Sepolia, Goerli and other EVM compatible chains.
