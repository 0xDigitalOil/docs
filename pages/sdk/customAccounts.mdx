# Custom Accounts

Custom 6551 account implementations are now supported in the SDK.

If you've deployed your own implementation, you can optionally pass the custom configuration when instantiating your TokenboundClient:

```javascript
const CUSTOM_6551_IMPLEMENTATION = {
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
  registryAddress: "<custom_registry_address>",
};

const result = tokenboundClient.getAccount({
  tokenContract: "<token_contract_address>",
  tokenId: "<token_id>",
  customImplementation: CUSTOM_6551_IMPLEMENTATION,
});
```

If, for any reason, you need to override the custom implementation, you can:

1. Create another instance of TokenboundClient OR
2. Override `implementationAddress` and `registryAddress` directly on when calling `getAccount`,
   `prepareCreateAccount`, `createAccount`, or `computeAccount`:

```javascript
const result = tokenboundClient.getAccount({
  tokenContract: "<token_contract_address>",
  tokenId: "<token_id>",
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
  registryAddress: "<custom_registry_address>",
});
```
