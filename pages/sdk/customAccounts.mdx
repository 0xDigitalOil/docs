# Custom Accounts

Support for custom ERC-6551 account implementations is coming soon.

Custom account implementations are now supported in the SDK.

The SDK supports custom 6551 implementations. If you've deployed your own implementation,
you can pass the custom `implementationAddress` and `registryAddress` when calling `getAccount`,
`prepareCreateAccount`, `createAccount`, or `computeAccount`:

```javascript
const result = await tokenboundClient.getAccount({
  tokenContract: "<token_contract_address>",
  tokenId: "<token_id>",
  implementationAddress: "<custom_implementation_address>",
  registryAddress: "<custom_registry_address>",
});
```
